        3. For each actionable item found:
           - Extract the task description
           - Note the source (e.g., sender's name or email address)
        Note:

        Direct Requests: "Send the report by Friday."

        Follow-Ups: "Review the contract and share feedback."

        Approvals: "Approve the budget proposal."

        Deadlines: "Deliver design mockups by tomorrow."
